# vercel-pnpm-monorepo-repro

## Build & Development Settings

With this setting, the vercel deployment will use the wrong pnpm version. (fallback to pnpm v6 in pnpm v7 project)

> WARN  Your pnpm-lock.yaml was generated by a newer version of pnpm. It is a compatible version but it might get downgraded to version 5.3

But if we turn off `Install Command` it can detect pnpm version correctly.
